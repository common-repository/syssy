== Description ==

SYSSY is an online platform for managing and monitoring websites.
We provide some plugins for connecting different CMS (content management systems) with SYSSY, so we can receive data about your website and can inform you if there are some problems or if you need to do any security updates in your system or on your server.
You can connect your Wordpress website and SYSSY with this Wordpress plugin.
Just add your API key of your project on https://app.syssy.net and connect your website with SYSSY.
SYSSY calls your Wordpress website via REST API and fetches your Wordpress versions, a list of your installed plugins and their versions, PHP and MySQL version.
On SYSSY platform you can see a list with all your projects if there is any need for a security update in your websites.
